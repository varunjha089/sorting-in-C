## Matrix Chain Multiplication

Matrix chain multiplication is a way to multiply a sequence of matrices in an efficient manner. The basic idea is to break down the multiplication of a chain of matrices into smaller multiplications, which can then be combined to give the final result. The order in which the matrices are multiplied can be important, as it can affect the number of computations required. A common technique to determine the optimal order is the dynamic programming approach called matrix chain multiplication.
